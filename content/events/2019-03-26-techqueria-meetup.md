Hello! Looking to meet more Latinx's in Tech? Come grab a drink and maybe a taco or two, and connect with other Latinx's in Austin!

Our inaugural event was a success this past January and we'd like to keep that momentum going! So join us for some good food, drinks, and of course overall great company - plus it's Taco Tuesday! Feel free to bring a friend!

New to Austin? This is the perfect opportunity to connect with others and enjoy a night out!

See ya'll there!
