Techqueria is a nonprofit that empowers Latinx professionals in the tech industry by building networking and career advancement opportunities.

We build Latinx-centered spaces that revolve around career advice, technical talks, mentorship, open jobs, networking events, speaking opportunities, and open-source and we work with both employee resource groups and tech companies to comprehensively affect change in the tech industry.

Los Ubers is Uber’s LatinX ERG and global community for Hispanic and LatinX employees and allies. Our mission is to empower, celebrate, and advocate for Hispanic and LatinX communities inside and outside of Uber. We stand for connecting and supporting our community through social outreach and
efforts, developing and retaining Hispanic and LatinX talent to succeed at Uber and beyond, celebrating and raising cultural awareness through events, and attracting incredible talent to join the Uber familia.
