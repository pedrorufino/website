For our March event, we will focus on ways all communities can protect themselves from online surveillance. This will be an event dedicated towards skill-sharing as cybersecurity is one field where there is not enough distribution of knowledge, even amongst tech-savvy groups. Our events are free and
open to the public, including allies. Food and soft drinks will be provided at this event.

Doors open at 6:30 PM. Event begins at 7 PM.
