In this meeting, some of the items we will be going over include sharing strategies we've used to create or engage our ERGs, lifting each other up, venting and discussing potential partnerships between our ERGs.

Upon arriving at Slack, you can just check in at any of the available tablets where you will be prompted to enter the following information

• your full name • your email address • your purpose of visit - meeting • and who you are here to see - Frances Coronel

Feel free to message Frances on Slack in the #ergs-san-francisco channel if you have any questions, comments or concerns.

If you have a specific topic you'd like to discuss, please also share it to that same channel and we'll add it to the meeting notes - we want your voice to be heard!
