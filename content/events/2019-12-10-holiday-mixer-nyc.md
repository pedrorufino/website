We have had a great year and now itâ€™s time to get together to mingle, and reflect on our 2019 accomplishments, talk about our goals for 2020 and how Latinas in Tech NYC and Techqueria NYC can support you to reach those goals.

This event is perfect for you if you are a LatinX technologist or an ally committed to diversity and inclusion. Small bites and refreshments will be served. Special thanks to CodeClimate, our wonderful host.
