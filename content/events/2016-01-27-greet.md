The idea of this group is to provide a space where we can share our goals, ideas, make new friends and find ways in which we can work together to reach higher. We have some ideas for where we want to take this community and would love to get your feedback and help come up with a great plan for this
group.

Let's meetup, share some pizza and beer, and have some time to make new friends and talk about the community.

See you soon!
