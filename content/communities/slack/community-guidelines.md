## Overview

We are a close knit community of Latinx in Tech, elevating each other as we grow into leaders within the tech industry.

Whether you're already a Latinx professional in tech or are interested in becoming one, you'll be joining a fast-growing community. We help each other out with problems/questions, share positive, support one another's concerns over compensation and workplace challenges and network through both
offline and online initiatives.

Within our Slack, you will find:

- career advice (anonymous option provided)
- community moderators who make sure the Code of Conduct is being enforced
- compensation advice (anonymous option provided)
- free conference tickets or discounts
- job opportunities
- local events
- member highlights
- mentors and mentees
- org wide updates from Techqueria
- platform discounts
- resources
- scholarship opportunities
- specific channels that cater to you - affinities, cities, passions, hobbies, etc
- and so much more

## Allies üíõ

Techqueria is committed to bringing together and elevating Latinx professionals in the tech industry through a vibrant and supportive community. üåÆ

However, it is not a requirement to identify as Latinx to be in this community which is why allies get access to 4 channels

1. `#announcements` to stay updated on latest updates from Techqueria leads
2. `#allies` to share resources and have discussions around allyship
3. `#events` to share events with the community
4. `#jobs` to share job opportunities with the community

The purpose of the `#allies` channel is for allies to share resources, events, etc with our community and to ask us any questions on how to partner up together or become a better ally. üß†

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, let us know in `#allies` and a lead will get back to you.

With your support, Techqueria can become a stronger & more valuable community for Latinx in Tech. üíõ

### Still want to join other channels?

We value you being a part of the community and your interest in being an ally!

To facilitate allyship, we are implementing best practices from other orgs that have been doing this type of work for a long time and adapting them to our organizational structure.

This organization exists as a space for **Latinx folks** to feel included in the Tech industry.

Generally allyship in underrepresented communities is there to support the community, not the other way around.

And so, while this structure is new for us as the community matures, we are firm in this policy.

We understand allyship is difficult (for everyone!), and we appreciate all the work you are putting in.

## Best Practices üß†

### Creating casual hangouts

Using [Polly](https://www.polly.ai/) and [Eventbot](https://geteventbot.com/), you can make it easy to coordinate casual hangouts in different channels.

We recommend first using Polly or [Doodle](https://doodle.com/content/doodle-bot) to decide on a time that will work for most people.

![Polly Poll](/assets/img/communities/slack/polly-poll.png)

Then use Eventbot to create an event so that folks can RSVP and can also get reminded when the event starts through Slack.

![Eventbot](/assets/img/communities/slack/eventbot-calendar.png)

### Use threads

This convo in the `#random` channel could have been a bunch of separate messages! ü§Ø

Instead, with threads - it turned into a more rich and focused discussion. üòå

Please do not use the feature "Also send to channel" as this causes the channel to become more noisy.

![Threads](/assets/img/communities/slack/use-threads.png)

### Refer to pinned posts

A lot of useful info is pinned to channels.

Make sure to check those out when joining a new channel. üìå

### Custom Slackbot Messages

If you use any of the trigger phrases, Slackbot will respond with a helpful message.

`please use threads`

Threads let you respond directly to a message in a channel, keeping the replies, images, and other files neatly organized in a single conversation. Threaded replies stay connected to the original message, and only those who have contributed to or are following the thread will be notified of new
messages. :please-use-threads-next-time:

`techqueria code of conduct`

All participants in the Techqueria Slack Workspace are required to comply with the following code of conduct - make sure to read through it! If you have questions, comments or concerns - reach out to us via #meta or contact us through our website. :taco:

https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct/

`profile picture`, `profile photo`, `fill out your profile`, `profile pic`

Your profile photo helps us know who you are in Slack. And if your photo is clear, it'll be easier for someone to pick you out in a crowd or at a Techqueria event. :blob-says-hi:

`techqueria logo`

### Useful Reacjis

#### Notice someone posting the same message to 3+ different channels?

<img src="/assets/img/communities/slack/chill-out.png" data-src="/assets/img/communities/slack/chill-out.png" class="lozad u-box-shadow--none" alt="Chill out with the posts">

The `:chill-out-with-the-posts:` emoji will be used to indicate that whoever is posting the message needs to slow down with posting the same message to different channels and chill out with the posts.

We decided to create this emoji because sometimes we see the same person posting the same message to 3 (or 10) different channels in Slack.

This obviously comes across as a bit spammy and overly promotional so to encourage best behavior, all messages with `:chill-out-with-the-posts:` will go into the `#meta-chill-out` channel.

That way, if we see that the same person is continuously doing this, we can reach out to them directly.

#### Notice someone posting in the wrong channel?

<img src="/assets/img/communities/slack/switch-channel.png" data-src="/assets/img/communities/slack/switch-channel.png" class="lozad u-box-shadow--none" alt="Switch to a different channel">

The `:switch-to-a-different-channel:` will be used to indicate that someone is posting to the wrong channel and should probably switch to a different channel.

We will not be having a channel set up for this but it's just another we are letting folks in a friendly way that they should post their message somewhere else.

#### Notice someone not using threads effectively?

<img src="/assets/img/communities/slack/threads.png" data-src="/assets/img/communities/slack/threads.png" class="lozad u-box-shadow--none" alt="Use threads">

Use `:please-use-threads:` to encourage people to use threads instead of posting in channel with a bunch of related messages

#### Notice someone who hasn't uploaded a profile picture?

<img src="/assets/img/communities/slack/profile-pic.png" data-src="/assets/img/communities/slack/profile-pic.png" class="lozad u-box-shadow--none" alt="Upload a profile picture">

Use `:please-upload-a-profile-picture:` to encourage people to fill out their profile and upload a profile picture.

### HeyTaco

The [HeyTaco! bot](https://www.heytaco.chat) sparks conversations and builds stronger relationships with its fun and unique kindness currency... tacos! üåÆ

You can use `@heytaco` to give someone a üåÆ when you'd like to show praise, appreciation, or to add a little happiness to their day.

1. Every person in our Slack Workspace has 5 tacos to give out per day 5Ô∏è‚É£ üåÆ
2. To give someone a taco, add a taco emoji after their username Like this: `@username your positive attitude was a real help today! :taco:` ![HeyTaco! Examples](/assets/img/communities/slack/hey-taco-examples.png)
3. You can give tacos to anyone on your team as long as the bot has been invited to the channel You can invite the bot to channels using `/invite @heytaco`
4. There is a leaderboard to see who is getting the most tacos Anyone in our Slack Workspace can sign in and see the leaderboard using [https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard](https://www.heytaco.chat/leaderboard)
5. Need help? If you need help, you can just DM `@heytaco` the word `help` and it will assist you.

## Code of Conduct üåª

You can find our code of conduct at [https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

In short, this is a professional community so be respectful of everyone and their identity.

Unprofessional behavior is **not** acceptable so if you feel that someone is breaking the code of conduct, make sure to contact an admin and we will sort it out.

### Why was my account deactivated?

Your Slack account may have been deactivated because of one of the following reasons:

- you violated our Code of Conduct
  - if someone reported you or we have noticed a violation, we will first deactivate your account and then contact you via email
  - if it is an extreme violation (like hate speech), we may deactivate your account and not provide the courtesy of following up
  - if there was a misunderstanding, we can reactivate your account but we're usually pretty strict on violations
- you requested it yourself
  - [anyone can deactivate their account](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203953146-Deactivate-your-Slack-account) if they'd like but you will have to contact us after if you want reactivated

### Can I DM leads?

If you DM a lead, we may not be able to get to you in a very timely manner due to our limited bandwidth.

We love getting DMs from our members but we feel we're doing a disservice if it takes us more than a week to get back to you with your questions, feedback, concerns, etc.

Ergo, for any questions related to Slack, the website, volunteering, partnerships or really anything related to Techqueria ‚Äî we ask that you please post in `#meta` to get a faster response.

### Contacting Admins
