Concrete Rose is an early stage investment platform focused on the diversity opportunity by capitalizing underrepresented founders, investing in companies serving underrepresented consumers, and helping early stage companies build diverse teams.

Concrete Rose-backed founders gain access to social capital via the Concrete Rose Network of best-in-class investors, operators, and public figures committed to our mission.

Through the Concrete Rose Foundation, they partner with organizations developing the next generation of underrepresented talent of color.

These grantees benefit from participation in the Concrete Rose Network.

The Concrete Rose Foundation approved a grant of $10,000 to Techqueria in August.

This is a one-year, unrestricted grant intended to sustain and amplify our organizationâ€™s impact.

We are so excited to be a member of the first cohort of Concrete Rose Portfolio Grantees.

Their intention with this first cohort is to support great work by best in class nonprofits while also continuing to build a platform through which leaders of these organizations share best practices and are connected to additional sources of social capital.

As a part of our partnership we will be featured as a Strategic Partner in the quarterly communication to Concrete Rose key stakeholders.

Additionally, Frances, Felipe and other key executives will be invited to participate in Concrete Rose events to share Techqueria's mission and impact.
