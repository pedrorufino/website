## About Eventbot

Eventbot lets you create events directly in Slack, no external apps needed! Get more RSVPs by putting your event in Slack - and use Eventbot to keep your event from getting lost in the scroll back.

## Sponsorship

This software sponsor will

- provide financial contribution to Techqueria in order to pay for a yearly subscription of Eventbot

In exchange, Techqueria will

- provide your company a partnership worth the financial contribution in value
- showcase your company under "Software Sponsors" on the Supporters page
