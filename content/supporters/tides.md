The Tides Foundation envisions a world of shared prosperity and social justice founded on equality and human rights, sustainable environment, quality education, and healthy individuals and communities.

Since 1976, Tides has partnered with innovative organizations to accelerate the pace of social change and solve society's toughest problems.

Tides granted us $5,000 in August for general support as per the recommendation of the GitHub for Good Fund, a fund of Tides Foundation.
