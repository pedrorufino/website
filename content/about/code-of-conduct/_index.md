> Effective November 10, 2020

All participants and members of Techqueria are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with Techqueria.

We believe in respect, compassion, understanding, and inclusion and expect all community members to act on these values.

We have no tolerance for any form of harassment; we expect everyone to act professionally and to follow the social norms of the community.

## The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Acceptable Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Referring to people by their gender pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain

## Unacceptable Behavior

Techqueria is a **professional organization** so the best reference for how to behave is how you would with co-workers.

If your behavior is not appropriate for the workplace, it's not appropriate for Techqueria.

It is important to note that the US Constitution protects the right to free speech, but only from infringement by the government itself. It does not protect free speech in a private setting, such as the Techqueria community. Additionally, any speech that is harassing and designed to trigger is
unacceptable here.

Techqueria holds the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any members for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Depending on the severity of the violation, the person will either be given a warning or banned immediately.

### Severity Level 1

For the following behavior, we will issue up to 2 warnings before moving forward with a ban.

  - e.g. "Sign up for this program that I charge for"
  - e.g. "Join this event that celebrates me" (and has nothing to do with Techqueria)
- Using pseudonyms to hide your identity
  - e.g. profile name is listed as "GreenBear99" instead of their actual name

## Alcohol

For all official Techqueria events, in instances where alcohol is present, the following is required:

- All attendees must have IDs checked to confirm they are 21+
- Alcohol consumption must be limited. Local chapters maintain autonomy for how to implement alcohol control measures (drink tickets, wristbands, etc)
- Additionally, it is at the local chapter‚Äôs discretion on how to handle alcohol at casual events

## Techqueria Leads

All Techqueria leads are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

If you feel a Techqueria lead (director, chapter lead, volunteer lead, board member, etc) has violated the Code of Conduct, please report that violation.

## Reporting Violations

Members¬†**must**¬†submit a report to start an investigation.

Directly messaging an admin or member of the Techqueria team does not start an investigation.

If you have any screenshots, please note that in the report, and we can reach out to get those from you during the investigation.

You can report a Code of Conduct violation by filling out a form [on our website](/report-violation).

## Enforcement

Techqueria's [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety) is responsible for overseeing Code of Conduct violations.

The process is as follows:

1. Member reports violation
2. Report is piped to a private Slack channel and email that Trust & Safety Committee members can access
3. Investigation starts and the Trust & Safety Committee members review the report
4. Trust & Safety Committee members vote to move forward with a deemed necessary response that is appropriate to the circumstances
   - e.g. message to both reporter and those accused that it's not a Code of Conduct violation
   - e.g. warning to violator and message to reporter notifying of warning
   - e.g. banning violator and message to reporter notifying of ban
5. Investigation has been concluded

Any emails must be sent using the `safety@techqueria.org` email which committee members have access to and any messages in Slack must come from a member of the [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety) or it is not valid.

If the committee cannot come to a decision on a violation, it must be escalated in accordance with [committee guidelines](/committees).

### When In Doubt

Techqueria's mission is to provide Latinx professionals with the resources and support they need to thrive and become leaders in the tech industry.

**When in doubt,** the mission of Techqueria should guide decisions of whether or not to ban a member.

Is this member helping to contribute to Techqueria's mission through their actions?

### Timeline

Investigations should be reviewed and enforced by the [Trust & Safety Committee](/trust-and-safety) within 30 days or less.

If an investigation takes 31 days or more, they must be escalated in accordance with [Committee guidelines](/committees).

### Cool Down Period

- After someone is banned, their cool-down period is 1 year starting from when they were banned.
- Members who have been banned can ask to rejoin again after their cool-down period ends.
- Techqueria is not responsible for reaching out when cool-down periods end. Members must ask themselves.

### Slack Guidelines

- You cannot ban a member from a single channel, only the entire Workspace.
- Members who have been banned from the Slack community are also not allowed to attend events and will be asked to leave if they are present.
- If a banned member attempts to re-join the Slack community using a different alias, email, etc, and is discovered, their cool-down period is extended by one year.
