## Overview

### Definitions

1. A **member** is anyone who is part of Techqueria's community.
2. A **committee** is a group of members formed to take responsibility for certain aspects of Techqueria with the support of Techqueria's board of directors.
3. A **committee chair** leads the committee.

### Number of Members

- Each Committee should have at least 5 members and no more than 11, including the chair.
- Each committee should be formed of 1 chair and 4 to 10 members.
- Each committee will have direct access to at least 1 member from Techqueria's board of directors for additional support.

### Terms

- Each member of the committee including the Chair shall have a 2-year term with an option to renew up to 1 time for a max term of 4 years.
- Terms will be staggered to ensure that the entire committee does not roll off at the same time and to promote future knowledge sharing.

### Meetings & Communication

- It is not okay to have separate meetings or channels created to make committee decisions.
- Staff and board members of Techqueria can be included in private committee channels but are not allowed to contribute to committee decisions unless directly prompted or otherwise noted in committee guidelines.
- If a committee makes a decision by voting, it shall make a reasonable effort to inform all members about the vote and give them a chance to vote outside of the meeting itself.
- Committee members should have the opportunity to read a summary of the meeting and share pertinent opinions before voting is finalized. If voting is held asynchronously, it must be left open for a minimum of 48 hours to ensure all committee members have an opportunity to give feedback.
- Committees can use [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) or a similar mechanism to decide on meeting times that are convenient for everyone.
- While the requirement is to have at least 1 meeting every month for 1 hour, these can be made more frequent if needed.

### Chair Selection

  1. They wish to serve as Chair.
  2. They are already a member of the committee.
  3. They are not the chair of another committee
  4. They have not Chaired that committee more recently than any eligible member.
- A Committee can not have the same chair twice in a row.
- If the only person willing to serve next is the current chair, this is a sign of an unhealthy group and should be escalated to staff.
- The Committee will make a reasonable effort to notify potential candidates that a new term is coming so that interested parties can declare their eligibility.
- A Chair is selected by majority vote from current members.
  - Votes should be private.
  - If there is a tie, the Chair will be randomly chosen.
- The candidates and selection are to be documented and made public.
- A Chair's term does not need to begin at the same time as other chairs' terms.

### Chair Responsibilities

- Chairs have responsibilities to their Committee: they represent the collective will of that group to others.

- Ensure that the Committee is notified of the agenda for the meeting in a timely manner in advance of the meeting.
- Attend and lead each Committee meeting.

- Ensure meeting notes are uploaded to Notion.

1. Meet the minimum qualifications
2. Submit an application
   - Application for new members should be shared in `#announcements` and closed after 2 weeks

   - Members not able to attend the meeting at which the vote occurs may submit their vote to the Chair prior to the meeting.

## Removal

A committee member should step down if they:

- violate the Code of Conduct
- miss multiple meetings in a row
- not actively contributing

A committee member may be removed at any time through a majority vote by the rest of the committee as long as there is advance notice that such a vote will take place.

A committee member can also voluntarily step down at any time.

If a member steps down, applications should be shared in `#announcements` and the process should be followed to select a new member.

If a Chair steps down, a new one is selected and a new term begins.

If you feel another committee member has violated the Code of Conduct, that should be brought up to the [Trust & Safety Committee](https://techqueria.org/trust-and-safety) by filing a report.

If you feel another committee member is not actively contributing or is otherwise unfit for the role, please bring it up with the board of directors by emailing [board@techqueria.org](mailto:board@techqueria.org).

## Escalations

Committee → Board of Directors

- If an agreement cannot be reached within a committee, the issue may be brought to Techquera's board of directors who will be responsible for making a final decision.
- Regardless of how the agreement is reached, the participating committee shall make a reasonable effort to record and post their decisions for transparency.

## Updating Guidelines

These committee guidelines can be updated by Techqueria's Board of Directors through a vote.
