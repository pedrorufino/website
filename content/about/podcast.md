## Sponsor the Podcast

Reach out to us at `podcast@techqueria.org` if you're interested in sponsoring or partnering on an episode.

Sponsor benefits include:

- The unique opportunity to be part of the first ever podcast focused on Latinx in tech that comes with its own vibrant community. A uniquely untapped source of stories and innovation.
- The Latinx listening audience is the fastest growing sector in podcasts. According to [Edison analysts](http://www.insideradio.com/free/edison-25-of-u-s-latino-adults-listen-to-podcasts/article_13e20f14-bb67-11ea-922c-73a10ab9722a.html), 25% of Latinx in the U.S. are monthly listeners.
- Latinx people are the most loyal brand connectors in the U.S., according to [CCG's 2019 Retail Customer Loyalty Study](https://www.customer.com/blog/retail-marketing/hispanic-brand-loyalty/).
- With a huge need to tell our stories properly and with necessary reporting context, the show aims to make a difference in our community.
- Hosted by [Jose Fermoso](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jose-fermoso), a tech journalist formerly of The Guardian and Wired, the show will have top media bonafides from the start.
- We will intentionally seek stories that feature Afro Latinx, Asian Latinx and Indigenous Latinx. It's long past time a Latino-led media company truly reflects the community's diversity.
