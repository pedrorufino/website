## Social Media

We are less responsive to direct messages on other social media platforms so it may take longer to get back to you or we may not be able to respond.

## In-Person

As of Spring 2020, we are no longer having in-person events due to the pandemic but we have plenty of [upcoming virtual events](https://events.techqueria.org/virtual-events/) and once it's safe to meet in-person again, you're more than welcome to meet local organizers in person through one of our
events that take place across our various chapters.

You can also check out our different [communities](/communities/) to keep informed on what we're doing.
