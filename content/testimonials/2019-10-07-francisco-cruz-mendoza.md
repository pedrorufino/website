Good news everyone!

I have a job!

After going through a few crazy twists and turns I have landed a job at Deliv :smile:

I am currently a Community Operations Manager where I manage a small team to optimize driver onboarding.

I could not have done it without yâ€™all either.

I dealt with a lot of rejection and people telling me how hard it would be to get back into tech after going to school over the past few months.

Made me question a lot, but through it all this community helped push me forward.

From going to events and hearing crazier stories than my own or even just reading through some of the introductions of this awesome community, it all gave me gas to keep pushing for something better.

A big shout out to @Frances Coronel for offering to help along the way, @felipe for doing the same, and @Pablo Carbajal for making my contributions to Techqueria 10x easier with his fantastic photography!

As I get settled in I hope to be more active and will be posting a lot more very soon!
