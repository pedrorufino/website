Artificial Intelligence has the potential to displace workers of marginalized populations including those of Latinx origin. AI is already perpetuating social bias and prejudice because it lacks representation of LatinX professionals in the AI industry.

LatinX in AI Org and programs are volunteer run and fiscally sponsored by the Accel AI Institute, 501(c)3 Non-Profit. Support our work by donating to our Open Collective.
