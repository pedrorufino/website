If you are interested in supporting Techqueria as an individual, one great way to help out is by volunteering your time.

## Volunteering Opportunities

You can find all <a href="https://www.notion.so/techqueriaorg/86b10a50006e48ad937198e25297af9c?v=410cd2988aa740fc860b165444327866" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our volunteering opportunities</a> on Notion.

However, we generally share the latest volunteering opportunities through the `#meta-volunteer` channel in [our Slack community](/slack/) and we are starting to share volunteering events in [Point](https://pointapp.org/orgs/364).
